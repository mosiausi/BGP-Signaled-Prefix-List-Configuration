        <abstract>
            <t>This document defines a new BGP extended community attribute, termed the "Prefix-List Community," which allows the dynamic assignment of prefixes to named prefix-lists via BGP signaling. The proposed extension enhances the configuration and operational flexibility of prefix-lists in routing policies by associating them with community attributes directly within BGP routes.</t>

        <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
            <t>In modern networks, routing policies or filters often utilize prefix-lists to simplify configuration by allowing a set of IP prefixes to be referenced by a single name or identifier. Prefix-lists can include multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, which are then applied consistently across various routing policies.</t>

            <t>The general structure for defining a prefix-list is as follows:</t>
            <figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[
                prefix-list &lt;name&gt; &lt;prefix&gt;
                ]]></artwork>
            </figure>

            <t>In this context, &lt;name&gt; represents a user-defined identifier for the prefix-list, and &lt;prefix&gt; specifies the exact IP prefix.</t>

            <t>To match no routes, a prefix-list might be configured as:</t>
            <figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[
                prefix-list PREFIX-NULL 0.0.0.0/32
                ]]></artwork>
            </figure>

            <t>To match all routes, the configuration might be:</t>
            <figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[
                prefix-list PREFIX-ANY 0.0.0.0/0
                ]]></artwork>
            </figure>

            <t>This document proposes a new BGP signaled mechanism to dynamically assign prefixes to prefix-lists using a new BGP extended community attribute, referred to as the "Prefix-List Community."</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Prefix-List Community Attribute" anchor="prefix-list-community">
            <t>The Prefix-List Community attribute is a Non-Transitive Extended Community that enables routers to dynamically assign received prefixes to preconfigured prefix-lists. The attribute can be utilized in both IPv4 and IPv6 address families.</t>

            <section title="Usage and Configuration" anchor="usage">
                <t>When a router receives a BGP route with the Prefix-List Community attribute, it will automatically assign the route to the corresponding preconfigured prefix-list. For example:</t>

                <t>- A router receives the routes "1.1.1.0/8", "2.2.2.0/8", and "3.3.3.0/8" with the community attribute "prefix:100:100".</t>
                <t>- Another route, "82.0.0.0/8", is received with the community attribute "prefix:200:200".</t>

                <t>The routes will be automatically assigned to the corresponding preconfigured prefix-lists as follows:</t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork><![CDATA[
                    prefix-list PREFIX-1 prefix:100:100
                    prefix-list PREFIX-2 prefix:200:200
                    ]]></artwork>
                </figure>
            </section>

            <section title="AFI/SAFI Support" anchor="afi-safi">
                <t>The Prefix-List Community attribute can be signaled in BGP updates within the following Address Family Identifier (AFI) and Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) combinations:</t>
                <t>- AFI=1, SAFI=1, IPv4 unicast</t>
                <t>- AFI=1, SAFI=128, L3VPN IPv4 unicast</t>
                <t>- AFI=2, SAFI=1, IPv6 unicast</t>
                <t>- AFI=2, SAFI=128, L3VPN IPv6 unicast</t>
                <t>- AFI=1, SAFI=4, labeled IPv4</t>
                <t>- AFI=2, SAFI=4, labeled IPv6 (6PE)</t>
            </section>

            <section title="Operational Behavior" anchor="operational-behavior">
                <t>The operational behavior of a router with the Prefix-List Community attribute is as follows:</t>

                <t>- <strong>Route Processing:</strong> A route received with only the Prefix-List Community attribute will be installed if there is a valid next-hop resolution. If the next-hop is invalid or cannot be resolved, the route may be placed into a hidden table but will still be used for prefix-list assignment.</t>

                <t>- <strong>Interaction with Other Communities:</strong> If a route is received with both the Prefix-List Community attribute and other community attributes, the router will process it as per standard BGP processing rules defined in <xref target="RFC4271"/>.</t>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
            <t>The Prefix-List Community attribute is a Non-Transitive Extended Community and should be treated with the same security considerations as other BGP extended communities. Care should be taken to ensure that only authorized routers and networks utilize this attribute to prevent unauthorized or malicious routing changes.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="IANA Considerations" anchor="iana">
            <t>This document requests the allocation of a new BGP Extended Community Type for the Prefix-List Community attribute from the IANA "BGP Extended Communities" registry.</t>
